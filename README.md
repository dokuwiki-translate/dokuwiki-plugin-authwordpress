## Installation and Configuration

Please refer to the [plugin's documentation](http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:authwordpress)
for information on how to install and configure this plugin in DokuWiki.

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
`lib/plugins/authwordpress/` - if the folder is called differently,
it will not work!


## Compatibility

This plugin has been tested with the following DokuWiki releases:

- 2017-02-19e “Frusterick Manners”
- 2016-06-26e “Elenor of Tsort”
- 2015-08-10a ”Detritus”

It will probably also work with *2013-05-10 “Weatherwax”* and later.

On the back-end side, the plugin supports WordPress 4.3 through 4.9.
It most likely works with any other 4.x version as well, although this 
has not been tested.
