## Installation and Configuration

Please refer to http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:authwordpress for information
on how to install and configure this plugin in DokuWiki.

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
`lib/plugins/authwordpress/` - if the folder is called differently,
it will not work!


## Compatibility

This plugin has been developped and tested with DokuWiki release *2015-08-10a
”Detritus”*, but will probably also work with *2013-05-10 “Weatherwax”* and
later.

On the backend side, it works fine with WordPress 4.3, and most likely does
with any 4.x version as well, although this has not been tested.
